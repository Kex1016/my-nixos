## Hi!

I made this repo for my own system(s). Since I'm new to Nix as a whole, it's definitely not up to standard, but it's mine.

## Install

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure `build.sh` and `build.nu` (optional) has execute permissions
   - `chmod +x build.sh`
   - `chmod +x build.nu`
3. Run `build.sh` or `build.nu`.

I also enabled auto-update, so the packages should be up to date most the time. I hate worrying about them.
